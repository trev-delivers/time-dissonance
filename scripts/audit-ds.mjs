/**
 * What is this app actually getting from the design system?
 *
 * ds:check already proves the vendored copy is current. That is a different
 * question from whether anything uses it — an app can carry the whole system
 * and still be built entirely out of hard-coded hexes, which is roughly where
 * several of these started.
 *
 * So this counts two things per app. Adoption: which tokens and components
 * are referenced. Bypass: the values that went around the system anyway —
 * literal colours, literal durations, literal easing curves, literal font
 * stacks. Bypass is the number that matters. It is never meant to reach zero
 * (icons need literal fills, one-off textures are one-off decisions) but it
 * should be small, known, and going down rather than quietly up.
 *
 *   node scripts/audit-ds.mjs            # this app
 *   node scripts/audit-ds.mjs ../a ../b  # several, with a roll-up
 *   node scripts/audit-ds.mjs --json     # machine-readable
 *   node scripts/audit-ds.mjs --detail   # with file:line for every finding
 *   node scripts/audit-ds.mjs --max 60   # exit 1 above a budget, for CI
 *
 * An app can declare deliberate exceptions in .ds-audit.json:
 *   { "ignore": ["src/map/"], "note": "basemap styling is not ours" }
