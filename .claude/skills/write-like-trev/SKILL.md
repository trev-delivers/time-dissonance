# Write like Trev

## Voice

Plain and concrete. Contractions are fine. Say what a thing does and why it's there, then stop.

Dry, specific, unfussy, with a bit of humour when it's earned. He writes like someone who made the thing and is telling you about it over a cup of tea. Examples of the real thing:

- "The unofficial archive of everything we've squeezed, drizzled, or regretted."
- "Built for sensitive skin. Product names link out to where to buy."
- "Nobody's written a word on this one yet."
- "No sign-up. Finds save to this phone as you go."

Notice what they do: name the actual thing, give the one fact the reader needs, and let a single wry word carry the joke ("regretted"). No setup, no moral, no flourish.

## Drafting rules

### Words

- Use the everyday word. Use, help, need, give, start, about, enough, show. Skip utilise, assist, require, provide, commence, regarding, sufficient, showcase.
- Never use: straightforward, delve, leverage, utilise, certainly, seamless, robust, elevate, empower, unlock, streamline, journey (unless it's a real trip), tapestry, landscape, testament, pivotal, vibrant, crucial, foster, navigate (unless it's a map), game-changer, cutting-edge.
- Cut intensifiers and magic adverbs: really, truly, deeply, quietly, fundamentally, incredibly, simply, just, actually.
- Say "is". Avoid "serves as", "acts as", "stands as", "boasts", "features".
- Name the thing. If the page has a dashboard, call it the dashboard every time. Don't rotate synonyms to sound varied.
- Prefer the specific version. "Saves to this phone" beats "stored locally". "12 recipes" beats "a growing collection".
- UK spelling: colour, organise, behaviour, centre, catalogue, licence (noun), practise (verb), programme (except computer program).
- Numerals for numbers: "3 projects", "12 years", "1 tap". Spell out only when it starts a sentence and can't be rewritten.
- Define jargon and acronyms the first time, or swap them for plain words. Internal names stay internal.
- No exclamation marks in UI. One in a whole marketing page, maximum.

### Sentences

- One idea per sentence. Aim for under 20 words; go over only when it reads better.
- Active voice. Say who does what: "We couldn't save your note", not "Your note could not be saved".
- Address the reader as "you". Use "we" only for the team or product doing something real.
- Front-load. Put the useful bit first: "Delete this list? You can't undo it."
- Contractions are good: it's, you'll, can't, we've, nobody's.
- No em dashes or en dashes as punctuation. Use a full stop, a comma, brackets or a colon. Hyphens in compound words are fine.
- Plain straight quotes and apostrophes. No arrows or decorative Unicode in prose.
- Humour: one light touch per piece at most, and never in errors, warnings, payments or anything sensitive.

### Structure

- Lead with what the reader came for. Context and reasoning come after, and only if needed.
- Say what it does, why it's there, then stop. No closing summary, no "in short", no tie-back to the opening.
- Prose over bullets. Use a list only when the items are genuinely parallel and the reader will scan or count them. Three or more steps in order is a numbered list.
- No bold-first bullets ("**Speed**: ..."). If every item needs a label, it probably wants to be a table or a sentence.
- Headings in sentence case, saying what's in the section: "How saving works", not "How Saving Works" or "The Magic Behind It".
- No all-caps eyebrow labels above headings (no "FEATURES", "CASE STUDY", "OUR APPROACH").
- Don't announce what you're about to say ("Here's how it works:", "Two things matter here"). Just say it.
- Don't count before listing ("3 reasons why...") unless the number is the point.
- Bold sparingly. Once or twice a page, for something the reader must not miss.
- Link text says where it goes: "Read the setup guide", never "click here" or "learn more".

### UI microcopy

- **Buttons:** verb plus object, sentence case, 1 to 3 words. "Save note", "Add recipe", "Delete list". The button repeats the verb from the dialog title. Avoid "OK", "Submit", "Yes" and "Continue" when a specific verb exists.
- **Destructive actions:** name the thing and the consequence. Title "Delete 'Weekend bakes'?", body "This removes the list and its 14 recipes. You can't undo it.", buttons "Delete list" and "Cancel".
- **Errors:** say what happened in plain words, then what to do. No blame, no "Oops", no "Something went wrong" on its own, no error codes as the main message. "We couldn't connect. Check your signal and try again." If it's the user's input, say what's valid: "Enter a date in the past."
- **Empty states:** say why it's empty and what to do next, in 1 or 2 short lines. A light touch of humour fits here. "Nobody's written a word on this one yet."
- **Labels and placeholders:** labels are nouns, short and permanent. Never put instructions only in placeholder text. Hint text goes under the label.
- **Confirmations and toasts:** past tense, name the thing. "Recipe saved." "Link copied." No "Success!".
- **Settings and toggles:** describe the on state. "Show prices", not "Disable price hiding".
- Don't describe position or colour ("the button on the right", "the green link"). Layouts change and not everyone sees colour.
- Don't narrate the interface. If the page shows the thing, don't also describe it ("Each sauce gets a page", "Tap a bottle and you get its page"). Cut the caption.
- Use the stock phrase for stock situations. A login wall is "Members only" or "Sign in to see this", not a sentence about who's allowed in or what's behind it.
- Keep it consistent. Pick one term per thing (for example "sign in" everywhere, with no stray "log in") and stick to it across the app.

### Commits, PRs and READMEs

- Commit subject: imperative, under 60 characters, no full stop. "Add empty state to saved finds". A body can be as long as the reasoning earns, written by the same rules.
- PR description: what changed, why, anything a reviewer should check. Short paragraphs or a short list. No "This PR aims to...", no closing pleasantries.
- README: first line says what it is and who it's for. Then how to run it. Then anything odd. No badges wall, no "Features" section of bold-first bullets.

## AI tells to avoid

Each of these makes copy read as machine-written. Fix them on sight.

- **"X, not Y" and "not just X, but Y".** Framing a point as a correction nobody asked for ("It's not a list app. It's a memory.") Instead: state what it is. "A list app that remembers where you bought things."
- **"Not X. Not Y. Just Z." and "X, never Y".** Same problem, louder. Instead: say Z.
- **Aphorisms and quotable one-liners.** "Good design is invisible." "Every pixel tells a story." Instead: give the specific fact or cut the line.
- **Lecturing about principles.** Opening a case study with what design "should" be. Instead: say what you did on this project and what happened.
- **Rule of three.** Lists of 3 adjectives or 3 parallel clauses by reflex. Instead: use the one that's true, or 2. Trev's own triple ("squeezed, drizzled, or regretted") works because each word is concrete and the last one is a joke.
- **Punchy fragment stacks.** "Fast. Simple. Yours." Instead: one full sentence saying what makes it fast.
- **Rhetorical question then answer.** "The catch? There isn't one." Instead: "It's free."
- **False suspense.** "Here's the thing", "But here's the kicker". Instead: say the thing.
- **Inflated stakes and significance.** "Transforms how you cook", "a pivotal moment", "reshaping the way teams work". Instead: say the actual change at its actual size.
- **Trailing "-ing" analysis.** "...cutting load time by 40%, highlighting the team's commitment to performance." Instead: end at "40%".
- **Purple and spectral writing.** Whispers, echoes, quiet hums, "something found in a drawer", feelings with tastes and colours. Instead: the plain physical fact.
- **Forced metaphors and "Think of it as...".** Instead: describe how it works.
- **Invented concept labels.** "The friction gap", "the curation paradox". Instead: describe the problem in ordinary words.
- **Promotional puffery.** Seamless, effortless, powerful, beautiful, delightful, intuitive. Instead: show the evidence and let the reader decide.
- **Vague attribution.** "Users loved it", "research shows". Instead: name who and how many. "7 of 8 testers found the save button first time."
- **Hedging and throat-clearing.** "It's worth noting that", "Importantly", "In today's world". Instead: delete and start at the noun.
- **Preamble and narration.** "Let's take a look at", "I want to be clear about". Instead: start with the content.
- **Affirmations and summary closers.** "Great question", "In summary", "Hope this helps", "Happy cooking!". Instead: end on the last useful fact.
- **"Despite challenges..." optimism.** Instead: say what went wrong and what you changed.
- **Opinion for its own sake.** Adjectives about your own work ("a clean, elegant solution"). Instead: say what it does and let that be the case.
- **Em dashes, title case headings, bold-first bullets, emoji as bullets, all-caps eyebrows.** Instead: see the structure rules above.

## Before sending

Run through this on every piece of copy:

1. Read it aloud. Would Trev say this to a friend who asked what it is?
2. Does the first sentence say what the thing is or does?
3. Search for em dashes, en dashes, " not ", "never", "just", "really" and "quietly". Fix each one that's a tell.
4. Any word from the banned list? Any US spelling? Any number written as a word?
5. Any sentence that would work on a poster or a mug? Cut or replace it with a fact.
6. Does it end on a useful fact, with no summary or sign-off?
7. Are the bullets really a list? If not, make them prose.
8. Headings in sentence case, no all-caps labels, buttons as verb plus object.
9. Is every claim specific enough to be checked? If not, make it specific or remove it.
10. Could you cut a third and lose nothing? Then cut it.
